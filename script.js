// Create a React App
/*

- A command line  tool to create React apps
- Development server 
- Use ES6 features which are not normally supported
- Keep our command modular
- Use build tools to create optimized code

For the React App to run the project we want to do, we use
'npx create-react-app my-app'
go to the project by using 'cd my-app'
and start the package that runs inside your project 'npm start'


ALERT! Must have at least node.js version of 5.2 or higher to actually make this work, check by using 'node -v'
